# freeCodeCamp: Timestamp Microservice

## Project #1 from the freeCodeCamp back end development course

### Objectives:

1. Build an app that is functionally similar to [this one](https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/) and deploy it to Glitch.
2. Create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project.

- **User Story:** I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).
- **User Story:** If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
- **User Story:** If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
