# freeCodeCamp: Build a Markdown Previewer

## Project #1 from the freeCodeCamp data-visualization course

### Objectives:

1. Build an app that is functionally similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/JXrLLE).
2. Fulfill the user stories, using whichever libraries or APIs necessary and adding personal style.

- **User Story:** I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.
- **User Story:** I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.
