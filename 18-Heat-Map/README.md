# freeCodeCamp: Visualize Data with a Heat Map

## Project #8 from the freeCodeCamp data-visualization course

### Objectives:

1. Build an app that is functionally similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/aNLYPp/).
2. Fulfill the user stories, using whichever libraries or APIs necessary and adding personal style.

- **User Story:** I can view a heat map with data represented both on the Y and X axis.
- **User Story:** Each cell is colored based its relationship to other data.
- **User Story:** I can mouse over a cell in the heat map to get more exact information.
