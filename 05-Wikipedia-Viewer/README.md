# freeCodeCamp: Build a Wikipedia Viewer

## Project #5 from the freeCodeCamp front-end development course

### Objectives:

1. Build a Wikipedia Viewer that is functionally similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga/).
2. Fulfill the user stories, using whichever libraries necessary and adding personal style.

  - **User Story:** I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
  - **User Story:** I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.
