# freeCodeCamp: File Metadata Microservice

## Project #5 from the freeCodeCamp back end development course

### Objectives:

1. Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to [this](https://aryanj-file-size.herokuapp.com/). Then deploy it to Glitch.
2. Create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project.

- **User Story:** I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.
- **User Story:** When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the JSON response
