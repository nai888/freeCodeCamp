# freeCodeCamp: Build a Tic Tac Toe Game

## Project #9 from the freeCodeCamp front-end development course

### Objectives:

1. Build an app that is functionally similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/KzXQgy/).
2. Fulfill the user stories, using whichever libraries or APIs necessary and adding personal style.

  - **User Story:** I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
  - **User Story:** My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
  - **User Story:** I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.
