# freeCodeCamp

## Ian A. Cook

This repository represents my school, my sandbox, my playpen. I'll be adding my projects from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) here as I work through them. Some of these projects will be high quality, finished products. Other projects will be incomplete, exploratory, and experimental. All of them represent my learning journey as I gain knowledge and proficiency in coding. I will add each of my projects below with a link to view them.
