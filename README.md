# freeCodeCamp: Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage

## Project #2 from the freeCodeCamp front-end development course

### Objectives:

1. Build a personal portfolio webpage that is functionally similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/YqLyXB/).
2. Fulfill the user stories, using whichever libraries necessary and adding personal style.

  - **User Story:** I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
  - **User Story:** I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
  - **User Story:** I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)
  - **User Story:** I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

3. There are many great portfolio templates out there already. However, you should build your portfolio page as much as you can from the ground up.
