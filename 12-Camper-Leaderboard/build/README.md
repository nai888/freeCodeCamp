# freeCodeCamp: Build a Camper Leaderboard

## Project #2 from the freeCodeCamp data-visualization course

### Objectives:

1. Build an app that is functionally similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/eZGMjp/).
2. Fulfill the user stories, using whichever libraries or APIs necessary and adding personal style.

- **User Story:** I can see a table of the Free Code Camp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.
- **User Story:** I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.
- **User Story:** I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.
