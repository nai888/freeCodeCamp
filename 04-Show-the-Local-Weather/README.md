# freeCodeCamp: Show the Local Weather

## Project #4 from the freeCodeCamp front-end development course

### Objectives:

1. Build local weather app that is functionally similar to [this one](http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV).
2. Fulfill the user stories, using whichever libraries necessary and adding personal style.

  - **User Story:** I can see the weather in my current location.
  - **User Story:** I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
  - **User Story:** I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
