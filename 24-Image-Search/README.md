# freeCodeCamp: Image Search Abstraction Layer

## Project #4 from the freeCodeCamp back end development course

### Objectives:

1. Build a full stack JavaScript app that allows you to search for images [like this](https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/imagesearch/lolcats%20funny?offset=10) and browse recent search queries [like this](https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/latest/imagesearch/). Then deploy it to Glitch.
2. Create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project.

- **User Story:** I can get the image URLs, alt text, and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.
- **User Story:** I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.
- **User Story:** I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.
