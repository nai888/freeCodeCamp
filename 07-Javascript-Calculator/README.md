# freeCodeCamp: Build a JavaScript Calculator

## Project #7 from the freeCodeCamp front-end development course

### Objectives:

1. Build an app that is functionally similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/rLJZrA/).
2. Fulfill the user stories, using whichever libraries or APIs necessary and adding personal style.

  - **User Story:** I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
  - **User Story:** I can clear the input field with a clear button.
  - **User Story:** I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
