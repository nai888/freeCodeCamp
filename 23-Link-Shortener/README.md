# freeCodeCamp: URL Shortener Microservice

## Project #3 from the freeCodeCamp back end development course

### Objectives:

1. Build an app that is functionally similar to [this one](https://little-url.herokuapp.com/) and deploy it to Glitch.
2. Create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project.

- **User Story:** I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.
- **User Story:** If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid `http://www.example.com` format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.
- **User Story:** When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.
