# freeCodeCamp: Visualize Data with a Bar Chart

## Project #6 from the freeCodeCamp data-visualization course

### Objectives:

1. Build an app that is functionally similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/vGjLVZ).
2. Fulfill the user stories, using whichever libraries or APIs necessary and adding personal style.

- **User Story:** I can see US Gross Domestic Product by quarter, over time.
- **User Story:** I can mouse over a bar and see a tooltip with the GDP amount and exact year and month that bar represents.
