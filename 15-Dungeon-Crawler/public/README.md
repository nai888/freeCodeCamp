# freeCodeCamp: Build a Roguelike Dungeon Crawler Game

## Project #5 from the freeCodeCamp data-visualization course

### Objectives:

1. Build an app that is functionally similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/PNJRyd/).
2. Fulfill the user stories, using SASS, ReactJS, and whichever libraries or APIs necessary and adding personal style.

- **User Story:** I have health, a level, and a weapon. I can pick up a better weapon. I can pick up health items.
- **User Story:** All the items and enemies on the map are arranged at random.
- **User Story:** I can move throughout a map, discovering items.
- **User Story:** I can move anywhere within the map's boundaries, but I can't move through an enemy until I've beaten it.
- **User Story:** Much of the map is hidden. When I take a step, all spaces that are within a certain number of spaces from me are revealed.
- **User Story:** When I beat an enemy, the enemy goes away and I get XP, which eventually increases my level.
- **User Story:** When I fight an enemy, we take turns damaging each other until one of us loses. I do damage based off of my level and my weapon. The enemy does damage based off of its level. Damage is somewhat random within a range.
- **User Story:** When I find and beat the boss, I win.
- **User Story:** The game should be challenging, but theoretically winnable.
