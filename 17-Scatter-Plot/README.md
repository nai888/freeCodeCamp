# freeCodeCamp: Visualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph

## Project #7 from the freeCodeCamp data-visualization course

### Objectives:

1. Build an app that is functionally similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/ONxvaa/).
2. Fulfill the user stories, using whichever libraries or APIs necessary and adding personal style.

- **User Story:** I can see performance time visualized in a scatterplot graph.
- **User Story:** I can mouse over a plot to see a tooltip with additional details.
