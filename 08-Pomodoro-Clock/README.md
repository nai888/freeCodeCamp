# freeCodeCamp: Build a Pomodoro Clock

## Project #8 from the freeCodeCamp front-end development course

### Objectives:

1. Build an app that is functionally similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/aNyxXR).
2. Fulfill the user stories, using whichever libraries or APIs necessary and adding personal style.

  - **User Story:** I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
  - **User Story:** I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
  - **User Story:** I can customize the length of each pomodoro.
