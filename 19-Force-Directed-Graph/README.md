# freeCodeCamp: Show National Contiguity with a Force Directed Graph

## Project #9 from the freeCodeCamp data-visualization course

### Objectives:

1. Build an app that is functionally similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/xVopBo).
2. Fulfill the user stories, using whichever libraries or APIs necessary and adding personal style.

- **User Story:** I can see a Force-directed Graph that shows which countries share borders.
- **User Story:** I can see each country's flag on its node.
