# freeCodeCamp: Build a Recipe Box

## Project #3 from the freeCodeCamp data-visualization course

### Objectives:

1. Build an app that is functionally similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/xVXWag/).
2. Fulfill the user stories, using SASS, ReactJS, and whichever libraries or APIs necessary and adding personal style.

- **User Story:** I can create recipes that have names and ingredients.
- **User Story:** I can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.
- **User Story:** I can click into any of those recipes to view it.
- **User Story:** I can edit these recipes.
- **User Story:** I can delete these recipes.
- **User Story:** All new recipes I add are saved in my browser's local storage. If I refresh the page, these recipes will still be there.
