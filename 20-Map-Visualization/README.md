# freeCodeCamp: Map Data Across the Globe

## Project #10 from the freeCodeCamp data-visualization course

### Objectives:

1. Build an app that is functionally similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/xVopBo).
2. Fulfill the user stories, using whichever libraries or APIs necessary and adding personal style.

- **User Story:** I can see where all Meteorites landed on a world map.
- **User Story:** I can tell the relative size of the meteorite, just by looking at the way it's represented on the map.
- **User Story:** I can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional data.
