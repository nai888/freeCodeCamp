# freeCodeCamp: Random Quote Machine

## Project #3 from the freeCodeCamp front-end development course

### Objectives:

1. Build a random quote machine that is functionally similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/ONjoLe/).
2. Fulfill the user stories, using whichever libraries necessary and adding personal style.

  - **User Story:** I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
  - **User Story:** I can press a button to tweet out a quote.
