# freeCodeCamp: Use the Twitchtv JSON API

## Project #6 from the freeCodeCamp front-end development course

### Objectives:

1. Build a Twitch.tv app that is functionally similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/).
2. Fulfill the user stories, using whichever libraries necessary and adding personal style.

  - **User Story:** I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
  - **User Story:** I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
  - **User Story:** If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
  - **User Story:** I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding `brunofin` and `comster404` to your array of Twitch streamers.
