# freeCodeCamp: Build a Voting App

## Project #6 from the freeCodeCamp back end development course

### Objectives:

1. Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to [this](https://fcc-voting-arthow4n.herokuapp.com/). Then deploy it to Heroku/Glitch.
2. Create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku/Glitch project.

- **User Story:** As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.
- **User Story:** As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.
- **User Story:** As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
- **User Story:** As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
- **User Story:** As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.
- **User Story:** As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
- **User Story:** As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)
- **User Story:** As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.
