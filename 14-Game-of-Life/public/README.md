# freeCodeCamp: Build the Game of Life

## Project #4 from the freeCodeCamp data-visualization course

### Objectives:

1. Build an app that is functionally similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/reGdqx/).
2. Fulfill the user stories, using SASS, ReactJS, and whichever libraries or APIs necessary and adding personal style.

- **User Story:** When I first arrive at the game, it will randomly generate a board and start playing.
- **User Story:** I can start and stop the board.
- **User Story:** I can set up the board.
- **User Story:** I can clear the board.
- **User Story:** When I press start, the game will play out.
- **User Story:** Each time the board changes, I can see how many generations have gone by.
